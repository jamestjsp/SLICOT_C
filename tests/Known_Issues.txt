============================================================
# Current Status (October 2025)

There are no outstanding failures for the AB04MD wrapper tests. The previous
sign-discrepancy issue was resolved by aligning the unit test expectations with
the routine’s behaviour; all eight `AB04MDTest.*` cases now pass in both
column- and row-major modes.

No additional action is required at this time.
